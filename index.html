      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like
        coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing
        keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just
        reboot the darn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
        benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

  <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe,
  and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by
  the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably
  more.

          Know for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and inrivales humility. Micahel is the creator of the
          <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
          and the principal author of the
          <a href="https://learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
          introductory sequence. Michael is also notorious as the founder of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a>
          and author of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a>
          , but the rumors that he's secretly a supervillan are slighty exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
            his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
              Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
              heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
              bus as he is from his kitchen table.
